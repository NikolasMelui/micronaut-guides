# Native Image with GraalVM

We are going to use https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM], the polyglot embeddable virtual machine, to generate a Native image
of our Micronaut application.

Native images compiled with GraalVM ahead-of-time improve the startup time and reduce the memory footprint of JVM-based
applications.
